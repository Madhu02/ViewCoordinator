We're hoping to ease the way that we present multiples UIViews onto any Controllers.
Instead of hiding views that you'd need to present at a certain time, you would just need to
drop all your views into a container, then use the ViewCoordinator mechanism to bring them back into screen.


## Example

To run the example project, clone the repo, and run `pod install` from the Example directory first.

## Requirements

## Installation

ViewCoordinator is available through [CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org). To install
it, simply add the following line to your Podfile:

```ruby
pod 'ViewCoordinator'
```
